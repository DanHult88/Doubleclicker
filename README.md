# Double Click Test to check mouse.

A browser-based mouse double-click tester designed to detect **accidental fast double-clicks (mouse chatter)**.

This tool lets you:
- Test **left, right, and middle** mouse buttons
- Detect **suspicious fast double-clicks** (default 80ms)
- Compare against normal human double-click intervals
- See per-button statistics and timing intervals

## Live version
(Coming soon – hosted on Vercel)

## How it works
The tool listens for mouse button presses and measures the time between consecutive presses **per button**.
Very fast intervals are flagged as potential hardware issues.

## Tech stack
- Vanilla HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Runs entirely in the browser
- No tracking, no data collection
